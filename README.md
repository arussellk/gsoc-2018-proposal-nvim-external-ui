# GSoC 2018 Neovim Proposal

A formatted proposal is in `proposal.safe.pdf`.
You can read, comment, and make PRs on the markdown in `src/`.

To create PDFs (uses `pandoc`):
```
$ ./build.sh
```

You will notice that `src/02-*` is not tracked in git.
This is on purpose and is because it contains personal contact information.
